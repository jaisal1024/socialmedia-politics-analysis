## Quick Guide 
1. JF-final.R is the R script used to quantitatively analyze Lee's Twitter Data.
2. The final paper is socialmedia_politics_analysis.pdf in pdf form and final.tex in Latex form. 
3. The image folder contains all the generated plots, graphs, and regressions for the paper.
4. If you would like to run the script yourself you will need to add an oauth_token.Rdata with your own Twitter API token.

Thank you :)
